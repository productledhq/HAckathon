## Sample Content

All content uses real examples from the Wes Bush voice guide:

- Free trial failures (ICP: 92)
- Slack's $5M ARR story (ICP: 94)
- Bad AI-generated content (ICP: 23) showing voice violations

## Next Steps

Once you approve the design:
1. We can fix Node.js setup to see the React version
2. Build the backend Processing Engine
3. Integrate with real podcast transcripts
4. Add content editing capabilities
5. Implement scheduling system

## Questions to Consider

As you review these mockups, think about:
- Is the Kanban workflow clear and intuitive?
- Do the ICP score colors make sense?
- Are the quick actions (buttons) in the right places?
- Should we show more/less content preview?
- How should voice issues be prioritized?
- What should happen when you click a card?
